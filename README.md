- [x] create a new app using Kotlin
- [x] use Interface callbacks with Kotlin
- [x] add the KotlinX Serialization library to an Android project
- [x] set up a class for Kotlin serialization
- [x] encode and decode JSON

### Module 4 - Kotlin Coroutines

- [ ] explain the advantage of Coroutines other Async patterns
- [x] set up app to work with coroutines
- [x] use annotations to ensure proper threading
- [x] prepare methods to be run on coroutines
- [x] spin up coroutine
- [x] move coroutine execution from one thread to another

## Requirements

Build an app which uses the spacetelescope api to retrieve videos and then build a view player to play them.

1. Use coroutines to execute network calls to the api
> return pair from http request method
2. Use the serialization library to process the JSON response

> You can use the `@Optional` tag and `Json.nonstrict.parse` to ignore non-necessary Json properties.

> add extention function to video to get the desired video file url that is specified in a constant

3. Write an extension function to the VideoData class (the one with the array of video_files) to return a video_file object based on a predetermined value which is stored as a constant in the VideoData class
4. Add a `VideoView`, `SeekBar`, and `Button` to the layout and use them to play the video retrieved from the url
   1. Button - can play/pause the video
   2. VideoView - Video output
   3. SeekBar
      1. Follows progress of the video
      2. Secondary progress tracks the buffer progress
      3. User can tap and drag to seek to different locations

> You can use the `kotlin-android-extensions` plugin that comes with your kotlin app to use the view ids as objects
